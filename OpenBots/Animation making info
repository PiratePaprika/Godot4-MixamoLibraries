Lets build some animation libraries!

The MannyQuin/OpenBot and OpenDog models are CC0 (I made them just now), and the metarig/game rig is GPL 3.0 license from this project.
https://github.com/SAM-tak/BlenderGameRig

They should be perfectly compatible with Godot's bone remapping features.

Open the blend file for the openbot, and use it to make animations. 
Push them down into the NLA and name them clearly for their action.
Export as a GLTF
Import into Godot and reimport the skeleton
  Be sure to map the bones on the skeleton, either yourself or using the provided MannyQuin-BoneMap.res file.
 Add your model to a scene
 Open your animations, and click the small save icon to save the "global" animation libarires you've created from blender.
 
 That animation.tres file can now be used on any other model that's mapped it's skeleton properly in Godot.

And share those libararies back here so we can all benefit!
